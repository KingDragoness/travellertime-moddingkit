/// @purpose: HideInNormalInspector attribute, to hide fields in the normal Inspector but let them show in the debug Inspector.
/// @why: Because this functionality should be built-into Unity.
/// @usage: Add `[HideInNormalInspector]` as an attribute to public fields you'd like hidden when Unity's Inspector is in “Normal” mode, but visible when in “Debug” mode.
